# AnomalyDetection

Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection Model/Web Application built using Python and Flask (can be deployed in AWS or Heroku). This was a Insight Data Science consulting project I conducted for a professional drone services company that assesses damage and other anomalies for their clients by capturing and analyzing high resolution drone imagery. 

Folder containing computer vision (anomaly detection) model and weight files not included in this public repo. The full and more refined python flask application is in a private repo. 

The Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection and Anomaly Classification Models trained and built using Python's Keras/Tensorflow are also held in another private repo.
